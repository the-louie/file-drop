# Comprehensive Code Review 2025 - Progress Tracker

Branch: `2025-revamp-cont`

## Issues to Fix (P0-P2, 10 total)

### P0 - Critical Security (3 issues)

1. ✅ **Issue 1.1: Synchronous File Operations Block Event Loop** - Commit `b6f8e8c`
   - Replaced `fs.readFileSync()` with async `fsPromises.readFile()`
   - Replaced all `fs.unlinkSync()` with async `fsPromises.unlink()`
   - Server no longer blocks during large file merges

2. ✅ **Issue 4.1: No Session Rotation After Login** - Commit `6c4e1a9`
   - Location: `index.js:510-518`
   - Solution: Call `req.session.regenerate()` after login
   - Implemented session regeneration before `req.logIn()` to prevent session fixation attacks

3. ✅ **Issue 6.1: IP Addresses Stored Without Hashing** - Commit `0a0d911`
   - Location: `index.js:983`
   - Solution: Hash IPs with salt before storage
   - Implemented `hashIP()` function using SHA-256 with server secret
   - All IPs hashed before database storage and in logs
   - GDPR compliant while preserving quota functionality

### P1 - High Priority (3 issues)

4. ✅ **Issue 3.3: No File Checksum Verification** - Commit `91241a2`
   - Location: Entire upload flow
   - Solution: Client calculates SHA-256, server verifies on merge
   - Client calculates SHA-256 using Web Crypto API before upload
   - Server recalculates SHA-256 after merge and compares
   - Corrupted uploads rejected with HTTP 422

5. ✅ **Issue 5.2: Missing Database Indices** - Commit `2cc6764`
   - Location: `index.js:366-386`
   - Solution: Add indices on sha, collectionID, timestamp, remote_ip
   - Created idx_uploaded_files_collectionID for collection queries
   - Created idx_uploaded_files_remote_ip_timestamp composite for quota queries
   - Created idx_uploaded_chunks_uuid for merge operations

6. ✅ **Issue 6.3: No Data Retention Policy** - Commit `5f6404c`
   - Location: Entire codebase
   - Solution: Configurable TTL for files, automatic cleanup
   - Added `file_retention_days` config option (default: 30 days)
   - Created `cleanupOldFiles()` function to delete old files
   - Scheduled hourly cleanup with startup execution
   - Set to 0 to disable retention (keep files forever)

### P2 - Medium Priority (4 issues)

7. ⏳ **Issue 1.2: N+1 Query Problem in Quota Checking** - PENDING
   - Location: `index.js:66-243`
   - Solution: Refactor to use Promise.all() for parallel queries

8. ⏳ **Issue 1.4: Web Worker Created Per File** - PENDING
   - Location: `static/js/global.js:466`
   - Solution: Worker pool pattern or single persistent worker

9. ⏳ **Issue 7.2: No Upload Progress Persistence** - PENDING
   - Location: `static/js/upload.webworker.js:324`
   - Solution: Implement resumable uploads (tus protocol)

10. ⏳ **Issue 7.3: Client-Side Debug Logging in Production** - PENDING
    - Location: `static/js/global.js:1` and `upload.webworker.js`
    - Solution: Environment-based debug flag, remove console.logs in production
